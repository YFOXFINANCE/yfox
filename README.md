WELCOME to Y FOX FINANCE !

Y FOX is poised to become the go-to decentralized finance (DeFi)
solution for staking, Farming, Lending and borrowing. Y FOX is the open
source decentralized protocol which enables users to earn interest by
lending, borrowing, and staking their Crypto Asset on Y FOX Platform.

also participate in the governance voting System giving them right to
vote on the forward progress of the protocol.
Y FOX Will also provide Services of providing Liquidity where users can
provide liquidity and they will earn interest on it.
Our network will focus on building these three primary functions as part
of the first phase. Our mission is to simplify the transaction process of
lending and borrowing of assets.

Staking

The Y FOX platform will feature a transparent, secure, and hassle-free
staking program. The Y FOX staking contract enables users who are
staking crypto asset to receive 30% of their total staked assets on the Y
FOX network. 30% staking rewards will be paid out in Y FOX token which
will be distributed to the stakers on the official Y FOX Staking Platform.
This staking rewards start accumulating as soon as the crypto assets are
staked and will be locked for a period of 12 months, these rewards are
then attached to your stake as soon as they are released.
PRODUCT AND SERVICES
Example use case: if a user wants to put his crypto assets to work and
earn returns from staking, the user will deposit his crypto assets into his
spot wallet and then transfer them to his staking wallet. A notification will
be sent to him that his tokens are staked and will immediately begin to
yield rewards. This staking rewards will be paid out twice a week into his
staking wallet. After a period of 12months, the user can free up his token
and the rewards accumulated by transferring them back to his wallet
where they can be traded.



Yield Farming

User on our platform will have the opportunity to provide liquidity and
earn rewards. A 30% commission will be paid out to user who provide
liquidity. These rewards will be paid using the Y FOX token.


Lending and Borrowing


The Y FOX lending Platform allows users to deposit their crypto-assets
as collateral and borrow stable currencies against them at a minimum
percentage of Interest. It would also enable borrowers to collect their
secure coins on loans and receive passive Interest as a type of Y FOX
token.
Example use case: if a user has good number of Ethereum and is
pretty sure that in the nearest future there will be a great spike in the
price of Ethereum and he or she does not want to miss out on this
gain but need liquidity for an urgent investment, that user can deposit
his or her Ethereum on the Y FOX platform and in return borrow the
equivalent of the Ethereum in stable coins which he or she can then
use for the investment and pay back with interest to reclaim his or her
crypto-asset (in this case Ethereum).

Mobile Application ( Android and IOS)


Our mobile app will be available on both android and IOS, it will
feature all functionality of the Y FOX platform. User can provide
liquidity from our mobile app as well stake and swap crypto asset.

delegate voting rights to the address of their choice. This token enables
the holders to govern the protocol. Token holder can weigh in on
discussions and vote on the forward progress of the protocol.

holders to receive a share of all said fees that are paid in Y FOX token.
